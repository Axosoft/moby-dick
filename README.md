# GitKraken How to Commit Example Repo
## Featuring Moby Dick

### Hi there and congrats on progressing with your exploration of Git and GitKraken üëã

This branch provides an example of making a commit using GitKraken and Git CLI. 

You can follow along with the [tutorial for "how to Git Commit?" on GitKraken.com][1].


#### Set up:

If you have not already done so, you will also need to [download GitKraken.][2]

## Git Commit a file with GitKraken

1. Open this local repository with GitKraken by clicking on the folder icon in the upper left, choosing 'Open a repo', and selecting the folder where you cloned this repository.

2. In the commit panel on the right you can see if any files are changed locally. Click on the 'View all files' checkbox to show all the files in the directory.

3. Click on `full-text-moby-dick.txt`. This will open up the file using the editor inside GitKraken. If you prefer to use another editor to open and work with the file, right-click the file to open in an [external editor][3].

4. Edit the file as much as you like and save your changes (ctl/cmd +s). Perhaps you want to change the author to be you. Or maybe use cmd/ctl-f to find and replace Ishmael with your own name throughout the text. 

5. Now uncheck the 'View all files' box and you will see only the modified files in the view. Your changes are now being tracked by Git and GitKraken and you are now ready to stage them. 

6. Click the top node on the graph labeled `//WIP` WIP stands for Work In Progress. The files you changed will now appear in the 'Unstaged Files' area of the commit panel.

7. You can either click the "Stage all changes" button or hover over an individual file and click on the 'Stage File' button that appears. Alternatively, you can click on the file to be taken to the Diff view where you can compare and stage individual changed lines in your document. 

8. Once you have staged the files, create your commit message in the 'Commit Message' 'Summary' and 'Description' fields. Summaries are limited to 72 characters but Descriptions can be as long as you like.

9. Click the 'Commit Changes' button once you are happy with your commit message. 


**Congratulations!** 

You have successfully edited a file and made a commit with GitKraken üéâ


*Now, let's try it with the CLI...*


## Git Commit a file with the Git CLI

1. Find and open the file `full-text-moby-dick.txt` with your favorite text editor.

2. Edit the file as much as you like and save your changes. 

3. Open your terminal or git-bash and navigate to the locally cloned repository containing `full-text-moby-dick.txt`.

4. Type `git status` and hit enter to show the current state of the git repository. It should show that the file you have saved is `modified` under the 'Changes not staged for commit' part of the message.

5. Type `git add full-text-moby-dick.txt` and hit enter to stage the file. By default, there is no feedback from Git if this command is successful. You can add the 'verbose' flag to the command to get a little more insight by running `git add full-text-moby-dick.txt -v` to get additional details.

6. Again type `git status` and hit enter. You will now see the file listed under the 'Changes to be committed' part of the message.

7. You are now ready to commit your changes and enter your commit message. To do this as a single step, type `git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE GOES HERE'` and hit enter. 

Note: If you run only `git commit`, Git will open the commit message to be edited by the default text editor in your terminal. This is typically a program called `vim`. While this a powerful editor, it is tricky to navigate for new users. If you find yourself in this unfamiliar editor, type `i` to go into 'insert mode', which will allow you to navigate and type as you like. Then hit the `esc` key and type `:wq` to tell the editor to write (save) your changes and quit the application. You can read more about `vim` at [https://www.vim.org/](https://www.vim.org/).


**Congratulations!** 

You have successfully committed a file with the Git CLI. üëè


## Next Steps

You are reading this on the `git-commit` branch of this repository. 

To continue on to practice reverting commits you can switch to the `git-revert` branch. 

To switch branches on GitHub, click the `branches` option towards the top left of the code view and select the branch you want to navigate to. 

To checkout the branch locally and pull from the online branch in the command line type `git checkout -b git-revert origin/git-revert`.

To checkout the branch locally using GitKraken, simply click on the `git revert` branch in the Remote menu on the right hand side.
